# T-3
Overview

This repository contains the work for Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security.
The task focuses on understanding basic networking concepts and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark.

Tool Used

Wireshark

Objectives

Understand basic networking concepts (IP, MAC, DNS, TCP, UDP)

Capture live network traffic

Apply protocol-based filters

Observe TCP three-way handshake

Identify encrypted and plain-text traffic

Analyze DNS queries from packet capture

Repository Contents
Packet capture file collected using Wireshark

THE  Main PCAP File is attached in the report   as the file is bigger then  25mb  Github restrict's its upload so a small sample Pcap file is uploaded

Summary

Live network traffic was captured using Wireshark while accessing common websites.
The packet capture was analyzed to observe DNS queries, TCP connections, and encrypted HTTPS traffic.
This task demonstrates how packet analysis helps in understanding network behavior and cybersecurity monitoring.

Learning Outcome

This task provided hands-on experience with Wireshark and improved understanding of how network traffic analysis supports cybersecurity operations.
